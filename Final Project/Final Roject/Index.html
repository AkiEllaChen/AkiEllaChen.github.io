    <h1>Rick and Morty:Monday</h1>
    <h2>By Hsuanhua Chen</h2>
    <p>My project isn't about any big issues, it's just a simple story between Rick and Morty, Rick convinced Morty to go on an adventure with him, instead of go to class. I chose to make this, just because I really want to make animation, but it way too hard for me right now.</p>
